Hey! This is the repo for my discord bot Emoji Dojo that is currently in development!
uh
yeah most of the cool stuff is in `data.js` and `commands/` have fun

FYI, the node modules you'll need are keyv, discord.js, sqlite3, @keyv/sqlite, and lodash

You'll also need to provide a config.json file with the bot token and a databases folder with a database.sqlite inside
